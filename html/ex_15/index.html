            The Pallister governments deficit for 2017-18 is expected to be lower than projected despite a collapse in personal income tax revenue caused by changes to federal
             tax laws.

            According to third-quarter figures from Manitoba Finance obtained by the Winnipeg Sun, the province is forecasting a core government deficit of $775 million for the
             current fiscal year, slightly below the projected budget shortfall of $779 million.
            
            The provinceâ€™s bottom line is even rosier when it comes to governments summary budget, which includes outside agencies such as regional health authorities, school 
            divisions and Crown corporations. Finance officials are now projecting a summary deficit of $726 million for 2017-18, well below the budgeted shortfall of $840 
            million.
            
            The 2017-18 fiscal year ends March 31.
            
            The improvement to governments bottom line comes despite an estimated $262-million loss in provincial income-tax revenue this year triggered by changes to federal 
            tax rates in 2016. The Trudeau government increased the top federal tax rate for income above $200,000 to 33% from 29%. That caused a short-term surge in tax revenue
            for provinces as high-income earners reported more of their income before the new tax rate took effect. But it had the opposite effect in subsequent years as less
            high-income revenue was reported for legitimate tax-planning reasons.
